# Unit2.PartyPlanner

<!-- Javascript Steps:
1. create a state
2. select the root div and store in a variable
3. target the form from the HTML and store it in a variable or create it dynamically in js
4. create a render function
5. create an async function to fetch the events and put them in a list on the page
6. create a button for each party in the list
7. create an eventListener that is attached to each delete button
8. create an eventListener for the form to add new parties to the list -->

 <!-- HTML Guides:
1. (async function to fetch(get) data from the API) a list of names, dates, times, locations, & descriptions of all the parties that are happening
2. (button added in HTML doc) we want a delete button attached to every party list to remove that party from the list
3. (async function to delete data from the API) write a function to request to remove the party from the list
4. (eventListener to handle removal) then the party is removed from the list
5. (form added in HTML doc) a form for users to fill out with new party info
6. (async function to post(add) data to the API) then the new party info is added to the list
    6a. create a querySelector.addListenerEvent to render function
   -->

<!-- CSS Thoughts:
1. how do you want the party information to show up on the website? card? table? --probably not.
2. do you need to make a class or an id for the delete buttons? --probably a class
3. how do you want to style the body of the page? --oooo pretty colors!
4. will you be styling anything else? div's? do you want to do that dynamically in js or html or in css? what would be easier to do? will you need to do a combo for adding styling?
